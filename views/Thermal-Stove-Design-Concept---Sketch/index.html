<p id="view-description"><h1>My concept</h1>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">I have designed a thermal stove which would only use solar radiation to generate heat and therefore be suitable for cooking at about 90 degrees Celsius.  The concept involves the photons (their trajectory trough the stove is in orange) moving inside the stove, first trough a concentrating (biconvex) transparent lens of Perlucor<sup>1</sup> (1) or another transparent ceramic (this is an economically-dependent decision).  Perlucor is a material which lets the photons go throw it, but at the same time, its thermal conductivity is high, it can be used with temperatures up to 1 600 degrees Celsius and it has a high index of strength and chemical stability (which contributes not to contaminate the food with chemicals).  Following this, the photons would get reflected on a concave spherical mirror (2), which would focus the photons at one point of the lens, which serves also as a surface to deposit the food, and could have a layer of graphene in the inner part of it (which is very thin and also transparent, strong and very good thermal conductor material).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The radius of the mirror, the radius of the biconvex lens, and the distance between each other would be fixed in order to focus the photons in one particular area of the lens (red) when they are reflected on the mirror.  However, this could only be done when the photons and the unit vector area of the lens is 0 degrees.  When the Sun is not at its highest point in the sky, we would need to develop a system which could focus the photons in the desired point just as before.  One possibility could be to put a mirror made of a good thermal conductor on the sides (3) in order to reflect the photons to the mirror (2) and therefore reflect again the light rays back to the lens, although I estimate that they would never reach the focus point (red), but we would still get heat from the material surroundings of the point. Moreover, this thermal conductive mirrors (3) would be connected to the lens, thus its temperature could contribute to the increase of temperature of the lens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In order for it to be safe, the outer layers and materials of the stove would be concrete (4) and glass (6).  Between the glass and the lens, and between the concrete and the conductive mirrors there would be an air cavity to prevent thermal loses and to increase safety levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Lacking the specific technical knowledge to predict the temperature that the focus point (red) would reach, I have allocated a cavity (5) below the concave mirror (2) where several options of nonrenewable thermal energy sources could be placed.  As an example with electricity, an electrical thermal system could provide heat to the inner part of the stove, which could increase greatly the temperature of the lens.  This could be used to provide support to the heat generation of the solar-thermal system or even to provide accuracy in the selection of temperature for specific foods (which could be applied in concordance with an electronic system to provide information about the temperature and automatically control the heat flowing from the non-renewable heat source into the stove to meet the specified temperature).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Advantages:</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:12pt;">The simplest of the systems described above should be cheaper than ordinary stoves.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:12pt;">Absolutely/very sustainable.</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Constrains:</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:12pt;">The area of the stove must be very big compared to ordinary stoves in order to focus the maximum (but feasible) amount of photons on the focus point (red).  This would entail that we would need new products to work with the stove, such as pans or pots.  These could be made out of the same material than the lens, so photons would still pass trough it and they would not have a significant influence over the concept.  Also, since the area is very big, they would need a system to place food on the stove safely and easily, and as a conceptual solution for this I have thought of the system used for the "pizza oven", which uses an utensil with a long hand grip to introduce the food deep into the oven.  This idea could be made out of the aforementioned material.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:12pt;">I have not the technical knowledge to determine if the area of the stove would be feasible for getting up to 90 degrees temperatures, so we may need another source of energy to be implemented in my model.  This sort of energy could be supplied by the spaces (5) below the mirror, in form of thermal energy generated by electricity.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:12pt;">I do not have the technical knowledge and technology available to determine if the mirrors on the sides (3) of the stove would have the desirable effect.</span></li>
<li> <span style="font-size:12pt;">Only suitable for outdoor and sunny (great solar radiation and high average of daytime hours) environments.</span></li>
